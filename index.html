        Arts and cultural funding bids can be highly complex and time consuming.
        I have extensive experience of evaluating and developing cultural &amp; creative projects and organisations; and writing competitive arts &amp; heritage sector bids.
        I have an excellent success rate in securing Arts Council funding. I have developed and submitted applications for both individuals and organisations.

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I am a highly experienced cultural and creative sector professional with a proven track record in project planning, brokering partnerships and securing resources.
        I have recently worked with two arts organisations securing them Arts Council National Portfolio Organisation (NPO) funding equating to £1.4million.
        I have excellent communication and leadership skills particularly in enabling and encouraging organisations and individuals to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a well-respected creative and cultural advocate, delivering strategic arts projects and utilising extensive regional, national and international contacts and networks.
        Whilst working for Arts Council England I amassed over 10 years’ experience of working with the country’s top arts venues, facilitating and soliciting strategic programmes and assessing and evaluating funded projects.
        I am an experienced evaluator having evaluated the qualitative and quantitative success of projects undertaken by individual artists and national organisations like UK Young Artists and Design Nation.
      </p>

        I have been an independent consultant for over 8 years. I offer a host of client services to both organisations and creative individuals.
        I offer expertise and can support you in three stages of a project lifecycle.

          <strong>The proposal/how are you going to resource it?</strong>
          <p>
            Once you understand the journey you need to go on and your outcome I can help you prepare your case for support.
            I can help you identify the most appropriate funding options and guide you through the application processes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluation</strong>
          <p>
            What are the lessons learned? What are the next steps?
            I can help you to evaluate your project.
