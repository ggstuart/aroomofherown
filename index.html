      <p>
        Arts and cultural funding bids can be highly complex and time consuming.
        I have extensive experience of evaluating and developing cultural &amp; creative projects and organisations and writing competitive arts and heritage sector bids.
        I have an excellent success rate in Arts Council grants for the arts applications I have developed and submitted for both individuals and organisations.

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I am a highly experienced cultural and creative sector professional with a proven track record in project planning, brokering partnerships and securing resources.
        I have recently worked with two arts organisations securing them Arts Council National Portfolio Organisation (NPO) funding equating to £1.4million.
        I have excellent communication and leadership skills particularly in enabling and encouraging organisations and individuals to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a well-respected creative and cultural advocate, delivering strategic arts projects and utilising extensive regional, national and international contacts and networks.
        Whilst working for Arts Council England I amassed over 10 years’ experience of working with the country’s top arts venues, facilitating and soliciting strategic programmes and assessing and evaluating funded projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been an independent consultant for over 8 years. I offer a host of client services to both organisations and creative individuals. I have built on my proven track record in recognising good quality creative projects to develop and invest in.
        I know how best to present your organisation and projects to significantly strengthen the likelihood of success.
