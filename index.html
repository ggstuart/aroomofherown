          Arts and cultural funding bids can be highly complex and time consuming. 
          I have extensive experience of assessing and developing cultural &amp; creative projects and organisations; and writing competitive arts &amp; cultural sector bids. 
          I have been an independent consultant for over 12 years. 
          I offer a host of client services to both organisations and creative individuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer to write your application yourself, I offer a "critical friend" reading service where I will look over your application and discuss with you ways you can strengthen and improve it.

            Whilst working for Arts Council England I amassed over 15 years' experience of working with the country's top arts venues, facilitating and soliciting strategic programmes and assessing projects. 
            I am a well-respected creative and cultural advocate, delivering strategic arts projects and utilising extensive regional, national and international contacts and networks.
            I have recently secured Arts Council National Portfolio Organisation (NPO) funding equating to £3million, including supporting Bamboozle Theatre to get a 50% uplift. 
            I have also secured significant funding through Reaching Communities, Projects Grants and a range of Trust and Foundations like Garfield Weston and Esmee Fairbairn.

        <p>
          I have been an independent consultant for over 10 years. 
          I offer a host of client services to both organisations and creative individuals. 
          I offer expertise and can support/mentor you in these areas.

            <strong>
              Provide <a href="access-support.html">access support</a> to submit Arts Council Project / Developing Your Creative Practice grants<br>
            </strong>
            <p>
              I am an Arts Council Access Support worker.
              I trained in counselling some time ago now, but the desire to listen and support has always been strong. 
              I recently worked on a research project and paper 'Meet Me Where I Am' that documented three neuro-different and dyslexic dancers' journeys to try and navigate the arts funding system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arts Council England will consider paying for an access support worker to support anyone who feels that they need it.
              It could be because you identify as neuro-different, dyslexic, have anxieties about form filling, are struggling with the process and the effect it is having on your mental health. 
              There is a very simple form to fill in and the Arts Council usually process your request within 5 working days. 
              If you think you need and might qualify for Access Support <a href="access-support.html">click here</a> for the form and examples of what you will need to provide.

              I regularly deliver lectures for the Royal College of Art and have delivered a series of workshops for Real Creative Futures covering topics such as "Are you funding ready?" and "Demystifying Arts Council funding". I can put together a day or half day that includes a presentation and mini surgeries to support a number of creatives who may want to start with some basic information to ascertain if they are funding ready.
