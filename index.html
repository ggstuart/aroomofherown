          Arts and cultural funding bids can be highly complex and time consuming.
          I have extensive experience of assessing and developing cultural &amp; creative projects and organisations; and writing competitive arts &amp; heritage sector bids. 
          I have developed and submitted applications for both individuals and organisations and have an excellent success rate.

        <p>
          I am a highly experienced cultural and creative sector professional with a proven track record in mentoring, brokering partnerships and securing resources. 
          I have worked with arts organisations securing them Arts Council National Portfolio Organisation (NPO) funding equating to £3million, including supporting Bamboozle Theatre to get a 50% uplift this year. 
          I have also secured significant funding through Reaching Communities, Projects Grants and a range of Trust and Foundations like Garfield Weston and Esmee Fairbairn. 
          I have excellent communication and leadership skills particularly in enabling and encouraging organisations and individuals to reach their full potential and realise opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a well-respected creative and cultural advocate, delivering strategic arts projects and utilising extensive regional, national and international contacts and networks. 
          Whilst working for Arts Council England I amassed over 15 years' experience of working with the country's top arts venues, facilitating and soliciting strategic programmes and assessing projects.
        </p>  
        
        <p>
          I have been an independent consultant for over 10 years. 
          I offer a host of client services to both organisations and creative individuals. 
          I offer expertise and can support/mentor you in these areas.

              Where are you at? Where do you want to be? How can you get there?
              I can support you to clarify what you want to achieve, what the outcome will be, what you need to do and who you need to influence to meet your aims.

          I have a proven track record in working with high quality creative projects.
          I know how to present you, your organisation and projects to significantly strengthen the likelihood of success.
          If you prefer to write your application yourself, I offer a "critical friend" reading service where I will look over your application and discuss with you ways you can strengthen and improve it.

              <strong>I am an Arts Council Access Support worker.</strong>
              I trained in counselling some time ago now, but the desire to listen and support has always been strong.
              I recently worked on a research project and paper 'Meet Me Where I Am' that documented three neuro-different and dyslexic dancers' journeys to try and navigate the arts funding system.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been supporting artists through Access Support for the last 3 years and have a good success rate.
              See my <a href="access-support.html">access support</a> page for more details.

          <div>

            <p>
              Arts Council England will consider paying for an access support worker to support anyone who feels that they need it.
              It could be because you identify as neuro-different, dyslexic, have anxieties about form filling, are struggling with the process and the effect it is having on your mental health.
            </p>
            <p>        
              There is a very simple form to fill in and the Arts Council usually process your request within 5 working days.
              If you think you need and might qualify for Access Support <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/hybWQR81QH">click here</a> for the form and examples of what you will need to provide.
