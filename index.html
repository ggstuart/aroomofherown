        Arts and cultural funding bids can be highly complex and time consuming.
        I have extensive experience of assessing and developing cultural &amp; creative projects and organisations; and writing competitive arts &amp; heritage sector bids.
        I have an excellent success rate in securing Arts Council funding. I have developed and submitted applications for both individuals and organisations.

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I am a highly experienced cultural and creative sector professional with a proven track record in mentoring, brokering partnerships and securing resources.
        I have worked with UK Young Artists and Bamboozle Theatre securing them Arts Council National Portfolio Organisation (NPO) funding equating to £1.4million.
        I have excellent communication and leadership skills particularly in enabling and encouraging organisations and individuals to reach their full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a well-respected creative and cultural advocate, delivering strategic arts projects and utilising extensive regional, national and international contacts and networks.
        Whilst working for Arts Council England I amassed over 15 years’ experience of working with the country’s top arts venues, facilitating and soliciting strategic programmes and assessing projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been an independent consultant for over 10 years. I offer a host of client services to both organisations and creative individuals.
        I offer expertise and can support/mentor you in these areas.

          <strong>Preparation and planning</strong>
          <p>
            Where are you at? Where do you want to be? How can you get there?
            I can support you to clarify what you want to achieve, what the outcome will be, what you need to do and who you need to influence to meet your aims.
          </p>
        </li>

          <strong>The proposal/how are you going to resource it?</strong>
          <p>
            Once you understand the journey you need to go on and your outcome I can help you prepare your case for support.
            I can help you identify the most appropriate funding options and guide you through the application processes.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I have a proven track record in working with high quality creative projects.
        I know how to present you, your organisation and projects to significantly strengthen the likelihood of success.
        If you prefer to write your application yourself, I offer a "critical friend" reading service where I will look over your application and discuss with you ways you can strengthen and improve it.
