              Arts Council England will consider paying for an access support worker to support anyone who feels that they need it.
              It could be because you identify as neuro-different, dyslexic, have anxieties about form filling, are struggling with the process and the effect it is having on your mental health.
            </p>
            <p>        
              If you think you need and might qualify for Access Support, there is <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/hybWQR81QH">a very simple form</a> to fill in and the Arts Council usually process your request within 5 working days.

          <div class="stuff">
            <p>
              Complete the form as follows:
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Name</dt>

            </dl>
            <p>
              Allow up to two days support for "Developing your creative practice".
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually between three and five days for Project grants.

            Please note Access Support is not about someone else developing your project for you, it is about removing barriers to enable you to submit an application. 
            You need to state what your support needs are and how barriers can be removed. 
            I tend to find that the breaking down of the process into manageable chunks and helping to ensure understanding of what the requirements of the application are - particularly the outcomes and investment principles, takes the most time.

          Each case is individual and different but the type of support I can offer includes: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading and going through the application guidance with you, helping ensure understanding and breaking down the requirements into manageable chunks.</li>
          <li>Taking notes and/or supporting during a funding meeting.</li>
          <li>Assistance completing the application form (this could be working together to fill in an offline/word application, working together on Grantium or me filling in onto Grantium.</li>
          <li>Spell and grammar checking – providing manageable pockets of support in an appropriate format particularly for individuals with dyslexia.</li>
          <li>Checking comprehension, making sense of project timeline, budget and narrative requirements.</li>
          <li>Assistance with using the online grants management system.</li>              
        </ul>

      <section class="row-2">

        <div>
          <h3>Preparation and planning</h3>
          <p>
            Where are you at? Where do you want to be? How can you get there?
            I can support you to clarify what you want to achieve, what the outcome will be, what you need to do and who you need to influence to meet your aims.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The proposal/how are you going to resource it?</h3>
          <p>
            Once you understand the journey you need to go on and your outcome I can help you prepare your case for support.
            I can help you identify the most appropriate funding options and guide you through the application processes.
